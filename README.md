# ML-Implementation

This repository showcases a collection of machine learning implementations applied to real-world datasets using R and Python. 

It includes classification (KNN, LDA, QDA), regression (linear, ridge, lasso), dimensionality reduction (PCA, PCR), clustering (K-means), ensemble methods (bagging, boosting), and validation techniques (LOOCV). 

Variable selection methods are also employed to identify key predictors, demonstrating practical machine learning applications.
